# LaunchDarkly Sample Java Application 

We've built a simple console application that demonstrates how LaunchDarkly's SDK works.

 Below, you'll find the basic build procedure, but for more comprehensive instructions, you can visit your [Quickstart page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/quickstart#/) or the [Java SDK reference guide](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/sdk/server-side/java).

## Build instructions 

This project uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org/). It requires that Java is already installed on your system (version 8 or higher). It will automatically use the latest release of the LaunchDarkly SDK with major version 6.

1. Edit `src/main/java/Hello.java` and set the value of `SDK_KEY` to your LaunchDarkly SDK key. If there is an existing boolean feature flag in your LaunchDarkly project that you want to evaluate, set `FEATURE_FLAG_KEY` to the flag key.

```java
  static final String SDK_KEY = "1234567890abcdef";

  static final String FEATURE_FLAG_KEY = "my-flag";
```

2. On the command line, run `./gradlew run` (or, on Windows, `gradlew run`).

You should see the message `"Feature flag '<flag key>' is <true/false> for this context"`.

Optional: If you wish to see analytic events generated by this sample application, change the SDK configuration to enable events.

```java
    LDConfig config = new LDConfig.Builder()
      .events(Components.sendEvents())
      .build();
```
